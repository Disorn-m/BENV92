#Tutorial 3 - Fuel Poverty Data and Logistic Regression
#Socio-econ variables

#Aim of this Tutorial
#1. Explore the Fuel Poverty Dataset, part of the English Housing Survey.
#2. Fit a logistic regression model that predicts whether a household is in fuel poverty or not
#using socio-economic data. Assess the fit of the model.

#The data:

#Downloaded from the UK Data Service - 'English Housing Survey: Fuel Poverty Dataset, 2019'
#This database is constructed from fieldwork carried out between April 2018 and March 2020.

#Logistic regression is a method for fitting a regression curve, y = f(x), when y is a categorical variable. 
#The typical use of this model is predicting y given a set of predictors x. 
#The predictors can be continuous, categorical or a mix of both.

# lets oversample - create more data for the minority class
# we could use SMOTE but be careful - this requires all features to be numerical (uses a k-nn algo)

summary(mylog2)#how do we interpret these results?

#Lets interpret a few significant variables:
#fpvuln: Being a non-vulnerable household decreases the log odds of being in fuel poverty (versus not being)
#A household is now counted as vulnerable in these statistics if it contains at least one household member who 
#is 65 or older, younger than 5 or living with a long-term health condition affecting mobility, breathing, heart or mental health condition. 

#Region: Living in West Midlands increases the log odds of being in fuel poverty, compared to
#living in the North East. 
#Living in London and the SE decreases the log odds of being in fuel poverty, compared to
#living in the North East.

#Tenure: Living in private rented, local authority or housing association homes increases the log odds of being in fuel poverty,
#compared to living in an owner occupied dwelling. So the ODDS increase by (e^Estimate)

#house composition: Over 60s Couples without children have increased log odds of being in fuel poverty,
#compared to Under 60s Couples without children. Same applies for most remaining categories.

#Working status: Houses where the head is unemployed or inactive, have increased log odds of being fuel poor,
#compared to houses where the head is working

#Ethnic group: Houses where the head belongs to an ethnic minority have increased log odds of being
#fuel poor compared to houses where the head is white
blr_rsq_mcfadden(mylog2)#apparently a poor model

#now we need to predict the test set results
pred_logistic<-predict(mylog2, type='response', newdata=test)#set type 'response' for probabilities
pred_logistic #produces probabilities! we need to choose a threshold.
y_pred_logistic<-ifelse(pred_logistic>0.5,1,0)
confusionMatrix(as.factor(y_pred_logistic),test[,1],positive = "1")
#Accuracy : 0.7, Sensitivity : 0.6, Specificity : 0.71

#ROC Curve using pROC package
test_roc_log = roc(test$In_fuel_Poverty ~ y_pred_logistic, plot = TRUE, print.auc = TRUE)#AUC:0.67 
#still poor, but better than with mylog1 model
